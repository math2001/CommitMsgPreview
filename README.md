# GitMsgPreview

After discovering this [gitmoji guide][], I've become a [(huge) fan of it][1].

I also want to respect this convention:

> the first line of your commit message should be less than 50 chars

As I consider that an emoji takes up 1 char, and that we have to type the *alias* instead of the
actual character, the ruler that I set doesn't work any more.

So, this plugin just shows the actual line plus it's length under the first one *only*.

The emojis are coming from the awesome [emojione][]
